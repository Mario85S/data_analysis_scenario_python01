# Credit Card Churn Prediction Project
## Problem Statement
"What marketing retention campaigns could we implement to help reduce customer churn?"

## Description
This project aims to identify marketing retention campaigns that could help reduce customer churn.
I have cleaned, transformed, and validated the data, then visualized it for further analysis.
The final visualizations were created for presentation, and key findings and folow up question with possible resolution were identified.

## Audience
Marketing Department

## Delivery
Presentation

## Findings - Current Customer Journey
- Total of 10K customers
- Experienced a 16% churn rate
- Average customer has been around 36 months
- Average age of our customers is 46 with a Credit Limit of 8600

## Final Questions to Marketing Team
"How can we get more customers above that 11,000 mark?"
- Churn customers tend to drop off heavily after the New Year, showing a 55% drop in Q4 to Q1 transactions. It's a good opportunity to find and target customers who have seen or are believed to show a large drop off around the New Year and target them with special offers, discounts, cash back, or loyalty points.
- Possible marketing reengagement campaign implementation to "prevent the cliff" for those who have seen this in the past? How big is this group, and what's the potential opportunity?
- Customer surveys
- Offer loyalty points, cash back, etc.

## Next Steps
Look at any historical marketing campaigns - can it be learned from what worked/didn't work?
